# CamCamPlus+ integration with GNOME Cheese

## About

There is planned support for integrating CamCamPlus+ technologies with other camera software. The very first one that came to my mind was Cheese (by the GNOME Software foundation) as it is my main laptop camera software. I am unsure how integration will work at the moment, so this is still a feature in planning.

## Possible integration ideas

Here are the current ideas for integrating CC++ into GNOME Cheese:

* Adding more filters

* Improving codec support

* Improving UI elements

* [Suggest an idea for a feature here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/CamCamPlus/issues/)
