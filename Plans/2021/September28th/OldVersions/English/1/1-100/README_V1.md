# Proposed features for CamCam++

## 2021 September 28th

Fix the issue that the Samsung camera has where the app closes automatically after 1-2 minutes of no activity (cc++ and Samsung Camera have entirely different codebases, I want to advertise that this camera won't have weird problems like this that never get fixed)

Toggling photo -> video, video -> image, etc. animations

**the big goal from today**

Make the camera as highly responsive as possible: opens instantly, starts taking photos, videos, and audio instantly, have the option to start the app where you were last (ie: stay on video tab until manually switched) no 10 seconds of time wasted in between menus and activators

Add support for burst shots

Add support for HDR

Create/use a sound for starting, stopping, and pausing recordings/captures

Integration with GNOME Cheese, KDE ?

Filters galore, scenic, beauty, and fun (poopoo head fiflter says the 5 year old, face swap, ahegao filter, clown filter, shnauzer filter, etc. (The dog filter is commonly made fun of, so lets add more dogs!) Dalmation filter, Cheetah filter, Giraffe filter, other animal filters, pumpkin head filter, metal filters (aluminum, steel, iron, etc.) Emoji face, i'll stop here, you get it)

QR code recognition and history (will also be put into a separate QR code program for SDE)
