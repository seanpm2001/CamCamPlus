# Name

I didn't know what to name a camera app. I didn't want to just call it `Camera` and the original codename `Freye of the cheese!` wasn't very good or memorable.

I chose `CamCamPlus` as it seemed cute. However, I have been getting internal reports that the name might be too childish, as "it sounds like the name of a kids app"

I have been nicknaming it `CamCam++` as it seems better; it doubles up on the camera and it doubles up on the plus. It sounds similar to something like `C++` or `Notepad++`

## TL;DR

The official name is `CamCamPlus`, but the alternate official name is `CamCamPlusPlus`.
