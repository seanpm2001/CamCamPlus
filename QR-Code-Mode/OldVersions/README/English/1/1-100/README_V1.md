# QR Code Mode

## What is this?

QR code mode is a library for CamCamPlus+ that detects and manages QR codes found in images when image scanning is turned on. It records a history of QR codes (also an optional toggle setting) and lets you view the link of the QR code in a web browser of your choice (out of the ones you have installed)

It can detect all types of QR codes, from level 1 to level 40 QR codes. This tool is written in C++
